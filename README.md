# iOS-Dev-Dining-Recommendation-App
This is an iOS based dining application that provides personalized, locational-based restaurants recommendation. It retrieves the text mining results on Yelp 5GB customers reviews and used machine learning algorithms that learns the user dining behaviours and offers recommendation according to their current location.
The incorporation of iOS MapKit and Firebase frameworks enabled the application to offer location supports and to consistently track users’ preferences. With the help of text mining, the features of users and restaurants were discovered and used in the ranking algorithm to rank each candidate restaurant near users’ current location. The results showed that the developed application appeared to correctly predict users’ preferences. The effectiveness of labelling each restaurant with their dishes also addressed a more intuitive and explicit user interface to facilitate the restaurants selection process.
Note that the current version is only supported in the city of Endinburgh, UK
